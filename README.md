# Sad Servers ☹️

This repo contains my journey into troubleshooting “sad” Linux servers. As I work through the challenges, I'll be adding my solutions to the `challenges` repo. 

The goal isn’t just to fix things, but to understand **why they broke in the first place** and experiment with different commands to find solutions.  

## What’s Inside 📁

- **`challenges/`** – Contains my solutions to the problems I've solved so far.  

**Tip:** Take your time exploring each challenge. Try different commands and approaches to really understand the issues—sometimes the simplest commands reveal the most.  

## Link to the Challenges 🔗

Challenge servers that I'll be solving can be found [here](https://sadservers.com/)
